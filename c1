* The Cyclops Doll, Prawn Suit Doll, and Seamoth Doll were all taken from [K07H's lovely Decorations Mod](https://github.com/K07H/DecorationsMod) via [AssetsRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper). The origin for the assets used by the Decorations mod was, I believe anyway, the core Subnautica game.
* This mod depends on [EldritchCarMaker's PickupableVehicles Mod](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker/My-Subnautica-Mods/tree/main/PickupableVehicles), as well as [MrPurple6411's BaseKits mod](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/MrPurple6411-Subnautica-Mods/tree/main/BaseKits/) and obviously [SMLHelper](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/SMLHelper).
* Key assistance was provided during development by [Tinyhoot/Raqzas](https://github.com/tinyhoot) (whose [Blueprints Randoimizer](https://github.com/tinyhoot/SubnauticaRandomiser/) should absolutely be looked at!), [EldritchCarMaker](https://github.com/EldritchCarMaker), [Lee23](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree), [Metious](https://github.com/Metious/), [Reika](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki), [MrPurple6411](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/), and others in the [Subnautica Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/UpWuWwq)! In addition, there was at least one anonymous contributor.
