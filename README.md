# Ideas for the Future

## Door Access Codes
* There should be one 50/50 chance lie for each door access code. Guaranteed access code description is "The code to the <location> is 0000" vs "The code to the <location> might be 0000" with a 50/50 chance of being accurate. This adds some gambling to the rando, which is good.
* Since we maybe won't need the base blueprints, maybe make the Captain's Cabin be a treasure trove of checks idk.

## Misc
* Support for transition randomizer
* Make 'finding the world's only fabricator to make the cure' a thing. Place a fabricator in one of like 5? different locations.
