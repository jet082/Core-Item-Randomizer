# Ideas for the Future

## Door Access Codes
* **SHORT TERM**. There should be one 50/50 chance lie for each door access code. Guaranteed access code description is "The code to the <location> is 0000" vs "The code to the <location> might be 0000" with a 50/50 chance of being accurate. This adds some gambling to the rando, which is good.
* **SHORT TERM**. Since we maybe won't need the base blueprints, maybe make the Captain's Cabin be a treasure trove of checks idk.

## Misc
* **LONG TERM**. Support for transition randomizer
* **MID TERM**. Make 'finding the world's only fabricator to make the cure' a thing. Place a fabricator in one of like 5? different locations.

## PDA
* **SHORT TERM**. List of all possible check locations.
	* **MID TERM**. Maybe build logic in to show what's currently accessible.
* **LONG TERM**. Maybe add in an 'all possible Fishy Fact/Lie' list that adds entries (across game saves) when new Fishy Facts/Lies are seen. That way junk hints still have some excitement to them.
	* **VERY LONG TERM**. Maybe add unlockables to completing the master fact/lie database? Some could be bad too - "UNLOCKED A NEW REAPER LEVIATHAN IN THE SAFE SHALLOWS" lol.
